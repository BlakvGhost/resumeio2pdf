## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Download the application by clicking the **<> Code** button and choosing **Download ZIP**.

2. Once the download has been completed, extract the files. You will end up with a **resumeio2pdf-main/** folder.

3. Open your terminal and navigate to the **resumeio2pdf-main/** folder that you have just extracted.

* You may have the option to skip this by simply choosing the **New Terminal at Folder** after right clicking on the folder.

4. With your terminal still open, type the command `python --version` to see if you already have Python3 installed.

* If you get a message with version information that looks something like `python 3.11.1 ‚Ä¶` then you can skip to Step 6.

* Otherwise, continue on to the next step.

5. Open your web browser and navigate to the [Python3 Downloads Page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and choose your operating system from the **Featured Downloads** section. Download the package and follow the installation instructions.

* Upon completion, restart your terminal and navigate back to the **resumeio2pdf-main/** folder. You should now see version information after typing in the `python --version` command..

6. Finally, you can run the `python3 ./main.py -sid SecureID -pdf "pdf output name"` where the provided URL is that generated by the **Share Link** on resume.io. When the process is complete, you will receive a message in the terminal that your file has been stored as **\[SecureID].pdf**. Check the **resumeio2pdf-main/** folder for your file.
